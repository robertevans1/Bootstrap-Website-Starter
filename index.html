    <h2 align="center">Bikepacking Georgia 2018</h2>
    <p>The nation of Georgia lies on the frontier of both geographical and cultural divides; straddled by the Black and Caspian seas, East meets West, Europe meets Asia, and Russia and the Middle East both loom large at the borders. This geopolitical conjuncture has lead to Georgia seeing more than its fair share of conflict over the centuries, most recently with dispute over the region of South Ossetia sparking a month of fighting in 2008.</p>
    <p>The north of the country is dominated by a large part of Europe’s highest mountain range; the Caucasus Mountains. For me and two friends, the allure of these mountains and promise of adventure were great enough that we found ourselves and our bikes flying in to Georgia’s capital Tbilisi, in July of 2018. Our plan was to bikepack a route over a couple of high mountain passes, following a combination of dirt roads and footpaths. We aimed to stick closely to the a section of a longer <a href="http://www.bikepacking.com/routes/caucasus-crossing/">cross caucasus bikepacking route</a>. We would travel unassisted, carrying a tent and some freeze dried food rations, aiming to stock up water and extra provisions whenever possible.</p>
    <p> What followed were 7 days of spectacular riding, some gruelling uphill bike pushes, a couple of run-ins with the notorious Tushetian sheep dogs, some sketchy river fordings and certainly the adventure we were looking for. Below are some notes and photos from the ride.</p>

        <h4>Day 1: Chargali to Roshka</h4>
        <p>We took a 4x4 for a couple of hours north from Tbilisi, 
          we were dropped at the side a of a dirt road near the village of Chargali. 
          A couple of mechanical issues assembling the bikes had us nervous we weren’t even going 
          to be able to start. The 35km ride was largely an uphill grind. 
          With the last section following up some hot steep switchback turns to the village of Roshka.

          <p>We enjoyed the descent from Roshka to the main road. 
            After that it was a steady climb toward Shatili for 15km. </p>

        <p> We stopped at Biso which had dozens of beehives by the road,
              buying a tub of honey from the ramshackle farmhouse. 
              Soon after we started climbing switchback turns for an hour or two, gaining 600m elevation.
               The honey helped us reach the top! </p>

          We explored the interesting old fortress in Shatili. Then we paused at green house hotel to
          try some Khinkali, georgian dumplings stuffed with pork, freshly made by the friendly grandmother who runs the kitchen with the help of the extended family. 
          We were invited to join the family to watch last half of England's world cup game.

               Thew water was cold, nearly waist deep and fast moving. 
               I fell in with my bike and bags on the first crossing, 
               Rob and James threw bags over and then made it across. 
               One of James' bags landed in a fresh pile of horse poo.

            <p> Avoided fording the river again leaving Girevi, instead taking a walking path. 
              Cruisey down hill roads took us quickly to Dartlo following the river. From Dartlo we climbed some way before descending to Omalo. The descent along the dirt road was a highlight, fast and flowey with a few bumps and rollers.
              We made it to Omalo in time for lunch, for which we had an excellent Georgian Fondue.

                 We cruised down from High Omalo to Diklo via a footpath. Hot and sweaty, around 30 degrees.
                 But the dusty mud roads were fun riding.</p>

                Made good progress and had breakfast just before the start of the albano pass. 
                Climbed 1200m on switchbacks.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-3">
                <p> After the climb we were rewarded with an incredible and seemingly never ending descent. 
                    General consensus rated it as the best road we'd ever ridden. 
                    The heat increased to 40C as we reached the valley. Riding the last 45km to Telavi in that heat was obscenely sweaty!
                    </p>
                    <p>Winemaking is thought to have originated in Georgia in around 6000bc, and as Telavi is the heart of Georgian wine country
                    we found time the next day to sample some of the local vintages, it seemed to perfect way to finish an fantastic trip!
